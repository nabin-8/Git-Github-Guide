git is version control system then 

What is version control system?
Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software/source code.

How/why does version control tracks software code?

Let's understand why:
   - In a large software there are millions of   code. to managing the code you use version control.
   - If there is bug in latest version of your  software you can easily switch to old or previous version of software.
   - git have track record of every version and very minor to major versions od software.

Let's understand How:
    Suppose you have file index.js
        const name="saiej";

        some code then another contributor
        contribute

        const username="hemanta01";
        git capture snapshot of every changes
        thats how git is called version control system
