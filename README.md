Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software/source code.

`How/why does version control tracks software code?`

Let's understand why:

- In a large software there are millions of code. to managing the code you use version control.
- If there is bug in latest version of your software you can easily switch to old or previous version of software.
- git have track record of every version and very minor to major versions od software.

Let's understand How:

- Suppose you have file index.js

  ```javascript
  const name="sairaj";

  some code then another contributor contribute

  const username="hemanta01";
  git capture snapshot of every changes
  thats how git is called version control system
